This program allows users to create a chemical compounds. 
It is used through a GUI which displays all elements that can be
used to create these compounds. The elements can be sorted based on
A few different constraints (Atomic number, different states)

To add a new compound, users input the name of the compound, and
the compound's chemical formula. To input a formula that cotains elements
that only appear once the user must include a 1 after that element.
